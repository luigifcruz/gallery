Welcome to my gallery! I'm Luigi Cruz, a Computer Engineer deeply engaged in the realms of GPU Acceleration, Digital Signal Processing, and high-performance model rocketry.

In this gallery, I share snapshots from my travels and visits to interesting places. The subjects vary widely – from cool electronics and massive radio telescopes, to completely unrelated scenes that catch my eye.

This hobby is all about spontaneity and ease, so anticipate a delightful — or not! — lack of consistency in what you'll find here.

To dive deeper into my technology-focused projects, I invite you to explore my [blog](https://luigi.ltd).

Enjoy!
